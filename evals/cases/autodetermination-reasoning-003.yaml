          See Important Reminder at the end of this policy for important regulatory and legal information.


          ## Description

          Blinatumomab (Blincyto®) is a bispecific CD19-directed CD3 T-cell engager that binds to CD19
          (expressed on cells of B-lineage origin) and CD3 (expressed on T cells).

          FDA Approved Indication(s)

          Blincyto is indicated for:

          · MRD-positive B-cell precursor ALL

          o Treatment of B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in first or second complete
          ☐
          remission with minimal residual disease (MRD) greater than or equal to 0.1% in adults and
          children. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on MRD response rate
          and hematological relapse-free survival. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent
          upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials.

          · Relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor ALL

          o Treatment of relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in adults
          ☐
          and children.

          Policy/Criteria

          Not applicable


          #### Appendix D: General Information

          · MRD-positive B-cell precursor ALL

          o In 2018, Blincyto received FDA approval for MRD+ B-ALL in remission based on a single-
          arm, open label study (BLAST) showing complete MRD response in a majority of adults
          undergoing Blincyto therapy; the new FDA indication includes both children and adults based
          on this pivotal trial.

          · Relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor ALL

          o In 2017, blinatumomab's labeled use was expanded from treatment of Ph- relapsed/refractory
          B-ALL to treatment of Ph+ disease based on a single-arm, open label study (ALCANTARAA)
          showing complete remission (CR), or CR with partial hematologic recovery, after disease
          progression on at least one second- or thid-generation TKI. FDA approved second- and third-
          generation TKIs for Ph+ ALL in adults include Sprycel and Iclusig. NCCN recommended
          (category 2A) TKIs for Ph+ ALL in adults and adolescents/young adults include Sprycel,
          Iclusig, Tasigna and Bosulif.

          See Important Reminder at the end of this policy for important regulatory and legal information.


          ## Description

          Blinatumomab (Blincyto®) is a bispecific CD19-directed CD3 T-cell engager that binds to CD19
          (expressed on cells of B-lineage origin) and CD3 (expressed on T cells).

          FDA Approved Indication(s)

          Blincyto is indicated for:

          · MRD-positive B-cell precursor ALL

          o Treatment of B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in first or second complete
          ☐
          remission with minimal residual disease (MRD) greater than or equal to 0.1% in adults and
          children. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on MRD response rate
          and hematological relapse-free survival. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent
          upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials.

          · Relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor ALL

          o Treatment of relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in adults

          Appendix C: Contraindications

          Not applicable


          #### Appendix D: General Information

          · MRD-positive B-cell precursor ALL

          o In 2018, Blincyto received FDA approval for MRD+ B-ALL in remission based on a single-
          arm, open label study (BLAST) showing complete MRD response in a majority of adults
          undergoing Blincyto therapy; the new FDA indication includes both children and adults based
          on this pivotal trial.

          · Relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor ALL

          o In 2017, blinatumomab's labeled use was expanded from treatment of Ph- relapsed/refractory
          B-ALL to treatment of Ph+ disease based on a single-arm, open label study (ALCANTARAA)
          showing complete remission (CR), or CR with partial hematologic recovery, after disease
          progression on at least one second- or thid-generation TKI. FDA approved second- and third-
          generation TKIs for Ph+ ALL in adults include Sprycel and Iclusig. NCCN recommended
          (category 2A) TKIs for Ph+ ALL in adults and adolescents/young adults include Sprycel,
          Iclusig, Tasigna and Bosulif.
