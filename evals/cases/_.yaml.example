# Test Evaluation Configuration
# ==============================================================================
# This configuration defines an OCR/NER evaluation test.
# It specifies:
#   - A descriptive overview of the evaluation.
#   - A disclaimer regarding limitations or conditions.
#   - The extraction pipeline to use (with the class to execute and the file location).
#   - A list of evaluator definitions (each with type, name, class, and optional arguments).
#   - The case(s) to run, which reference case-specific configurations.

  # Description: A human-readable explanation of the evaluation purpose.
  description: >
    Evaluation for OCR/NER extraction on case "ocr-ner-001-a".
    This evaluation verifies that clinical details (patient, physician, and other clinical information)
    are correctly extracted from medical documents.

  # Disclaimer: Notes any limitations or special conditions.
  disclaimer: >
    Evaluations are performed zero-shot without additional fine-tuning; results may vary based on document quality.

  # Pipeline: Defines the extraction pipeline details.
  pipeline:
    # class: The fully qualified class name of the extraction pipeline implementation.
    #         Format: module_path:ClassName
    class: src.pipeline.clinicalExtractor.evaluator.ClinicalExtractorEvaluator
    # uploaded_files: The path (or glob pattern) pointing to the documents that will be processed.

  # Evaluators: A list of evaluators (metrics) to be applied to the pipeline output.
  evaluators:
    - type: azure          # Type: "azure" for built-in Azure evaluators; "custom" for user-defined evaluators.
      name: "RougeScoreEvaluator"    # Unique name/identifier for this evaluator.
      # class: Fully qualified class path for the evaluator.

# ==============================================================================
# Case-Specific Configuration (Example: ocr-ner-001-a.v0)
# ==============================================================================
# This section provides details for a specific test case.
# It includes:
#   - metrics: The list of evaluator names (from the above "evaluators" section) that should generate metrics.
#   - Custom evaluator settings: (Optional) A mapping of parameters for any evaluator that needs case-specific configuration.
#   - evaluations: An array of evaluation items. Each item maps a query (the output field key) to its expected ground truth value.
# ==============================================================================

ocr-ner-001-a.v0:
  # Metrics: List of evaluator names (must match those defined in the evaluators section).
  metrics: [RougeScoreEvaluator, MeteorScoreEvaluator, BleuScoreEvaluator, FuzzyEvaluator]

  # Custom evaluator settings for a specific evaluator (if needed).
  # In this example, parameters for the custom "FuzzyEvaluator" are provided.
  FuzzyEvaluator:
    similarity_threshold: 95.0

  # Evaluations: A list of individual field evaluations.
  # Each item should have:
  #   - query: A dot-notated key identifying the specific output field.
  #   - ground_truth: The expected (desensitized) value for that field.
