## üåç Overview

Prior Authorization (PA) is a critical step in healthcare delivery, requiring providers to seek approval from payors before offering certain treatments. While essential for cost control and care management, the current PA process is often manual, fragmented, and time-consuming:

- **Provider Burden**: Physicians handle an average of **41 PA requests per week**, consuming **13 hours**‚Äîalmost two full working days‚Äîleading to high administrative burdens (88% of physicians report it as high or extremely high). [\[1\]](https://www.ama-assn.org/)
- **Payor Costs**: Up to 75% of PA tasks are manual, costing around **$3.14 per request**, and can be reduced by up to 40% through AI-driven automation. [\[2\]](https://sagilityhealth.com/) [\[3\]](https://www.mckinsey.com/)
- **Patient Outcomes**: **93% of physicians** state PA delays necessary care, and **82% of patients** sometimes abandon treatments due to these delays. Even a one-week delay in critical treatments like cancer can increase mortality risk by 1.2‚Äì3.2%. [\[1\]](https://www.ama-assn.org/) [\[3\]](https://www.mckinsey.com/)

This repository aims to **streamline and automate** the PA process using Azure AI, Agentic workflows, and advanced reasoning models. By leveraging machine learning, OCR, and agentic retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), we can reduce human labor, cut costs, and ultimately improve patient care.

## ü§ñ Introducing AutoAuth

**AutoAuth** revolutionizes the Prior Authorization process through:

- **Intelligent Document Analysis**: OCR and LLM-driven extraction of clinical details from various document types.
- **Smart Policy Matching**: Hybrid retrieval systems (Vector + BM25) identify relevant policies and criteria swiftly.
- **Advanced Reasoning Models**: Assess compliance against policies, recommend Approve/Deny decisions, or request additional info with full traceability.

## üéâ Why This Repository?

1. **Faster Decisions & Cost Efficiency**:
   Transform days-long PA turnarounds into hours, drastically reducing administrative overhead and associated costs.

2. **Improved Patient Outcomes**:
   Accelerate treatment approvals, minimize delays in critical care, and enhance overall patient satisfaction.

3. **Automated Infrastructure**:
   Utilize pre-built Azure Bicep templates and one-click deployment to set up the necessary infrastructure‚ÄîAzure OpenAI, Storage, Cognitive Services‚Äîwithout manual, time-consuming configurations.

4. **LLMOps & Evaluation with AI Studio**:
   Leverage Azure AI Studio for continuous model performance evaluation and prompt optimization. Implement robust LLMOps practices, ensuring consistent improvements in accuracy and reliability over time.

5. **Agentic Interactions via Semantic Kernel**:
   Integrate Semantic Kernel to enable agentic interactions with the LLM, coordinating policy retrieval, data extraction, and decision-making steps efficiently and autonomously.

6. **Research-Proven Prompts & Fine-Tuning**:
   Benefit from research-backed prompt engineering strategies that improve precision and reduce hallucinations in model outputs, ensuring that the system‚Äôs recommendations align closely with clinical and policy requirements.

## ‚úÖ What's Next?

### Near-Term Goals
- [ ] **Public Image Availability**: Host container images publicly (e.g., on Azure Container Registry) for easier and more flexible deployments, built by this repo and CI/CD.
- [ ] **Multi-Language & Region Support**: Adapt LLM models and policies for multiple languages and healthcare regulatory environments.
- [ ] **API Management (APIM) Integration**: Introduce APIM for secure, scalable, and controlled access to the service‚Äôs endpoints.
- [ ] **Deeper LLMOps with AI Studio**: Extend AI Studio integration for advanced model lifecycle management, enhanced logging, continuous monitoring, and end-to-end orchestration.
