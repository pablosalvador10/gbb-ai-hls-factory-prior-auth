## 🚀 Suggested Workflow for an Effective Development Process

This workflow enables the team to collaboratively build a robust, user-centered software product while upholding high technical and product standards.

### 1. Start with a New Issue
Kick off your contribution by creating a new issue in the repository's issue tracker. Use GitHub Issues for tracking bugs and requesting features.

🔗 **[GitHub Issues Quickstart Guide](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/quickstart#:~:text=Opening%20a%20blank%20issue%201%20On%20GitHub.com%2C%20navigate,uses%20issue%20templates%2C%20click%20Open%20a%20blank%20issue).**

---

### 2. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.example.com/{your_project}.git
```

---

### 3. Set Up Your Development Environment
#### Modify `environment.yaml`
```yaml
name: my-template-environment
channels:
  - conda-forge
  - defaults
dependencies:
  - python=3.10
  - pip
  - pip:
      - -r requirements.txt
      - -r requirements-codequality.txt
```

#### Creating and Activating the Conda Environment
For Windows:
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yaml
conda activate pa-ai-env
```
For Linux (or WSL):
```bash
make create_conda_env
conda activate pa-ai-env
```

---

### 4. Create a New Branch for Features or Bug Fixes
```bash
git checkout -b feature/YourFeatureName_or_bugfix/YourBugFixName
```
📌 **Branching Strategy**
- `feature/new_feature` → Development  
- `staging` → Testing & validation  
- `main` → Production

---

### 5. Incorporate Tests and Update Documentation
- **Unit Tests** → `tests/test_my_module.py`
- **Integration Tests** → `tests/integration/`
- **Documentation** → Update docstrings & README

---

### 6. Run Tests & Style Checks
```bash
make run_code_quality_checks
make run_tests
```

---

### 7. Update Requirements & Document Changes
**Versioning:**
- **Major (5.0.0)** → Breaking changes  
- **Minor (5.1.0)** → New features  
- **Patch (5.1.4)** → Fixes  

---

### 8. Commit & Push Your Changes
```bash
git commit -m 'TypeOfChange: Brief description of the change'
git push origin YourBranchName
```

---

### 9. Create a Well-Documented Pull Request
- Open a pull request (PR) targeting either the `staging` or `main` branch.
- Link to an issue: `Closes #XXX`
- Follow PR template
- Await **WG review** & GitHub CI checks

🔗 **[GitHub PR Guide](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).**

---

## 📦 Additional Setup Steps
### 🔧 Setting Up VSCode for Jupyter Notebooks
- Install `Python` & `Jupyter` extensions
- Attach Conda kernel: `pa-ai-env`
- Run `01-indexing-content.ipynb`

### 🔍 Configuring Pre-commit Hooks
```bash
make set_up_precommit_and_prepush
```

---

## 💡 Development Tips
### 🧪 Commit to Testing Early
- Quick identification of bugs  
- Improves maintainability  
- Understands performance  

### 📓 Using `%%ipytest` for Interactive Testing
```python
%%ipytest
def test_add_numbers():
    assert add_numbers(1, 2) == 3
    assert add_numbers(-1, 1) == 0
```

## 🛠 Working Groups
Each Working Group (WG) oversees a key area of the project.

| Working Group | Scope |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Application Deployment WG** | CI/CD, containerization, branching strategy, Cloud provisioning, security, automation |
| **App Development WG** | Frontend, backend, features, APIs |
| **AIOps WG** | Prompt engineering, model evaluation, monitoring, extraction |

📌 **WG leads track tasks in GitHub Projects and coordinate with the Steering Committee for releases.**

---

## 🚀 Release Strategy
### 📋 Release Planning
- The **Steering Committee** defines release scope  
- **WG leads commit features & fixes**  
- Progress tracked in **GitHub Projects**  

### 🔀 Branching Strategy
- `main` → Stable  
- `release/x.y` → In-progress releases  
- `hotfix/x.y.z` → Critical patches  

### 📊 Managing Releases in GitHub Projects
1. Create **Release Project**
2. Add issues & PRs  
3. Track progress (`To Do` → `In Progress` → `Done`)  
4. Final validation  
5. **Cut release branch & publish notes**  

---

## 🔧 Steering Committee
A **three-person Steering Committee** oversees governance, release planning, and issue resolution.

**Responsibilities:**
- Approving new Working Groups  
- Resolving PR disputes  
- Roadmap alignment  
- Managing cloud resources  

📌 **Steering Committee Members:**
| Member | Working Group |
|--------|--------------|
| **[Pablo Salvador Lopez](https://github.com/pablosalvador10)** | App Development |
| **[Marcin Jimenez](https://github.com/marcjimz)** | AIOps |
