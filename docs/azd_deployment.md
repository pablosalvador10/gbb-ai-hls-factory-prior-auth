This guide covers how to deploy the project end-to-end with Azure Developer CLI (azd).

## Prerequisites

1. **Azure Role Permissions (Subscription Scope)**
    - You need `Contributor` to provision resources.
    - You need `User Access Administrator` to assign roles to managed identities.

2. **Install Azure Developer CLI**
    - Follow the [installation guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd).

3. **Initialize Environment**
    - Run `azd init` to prepare your environment.
        -  Be sure to select "Use code in the current directory"

## Deployment Steps

1. **Deploy**
    - Use `azd up` to provision and deploy.
    - If you want to deploy only a specific service, use `azd deploy <service>` (e.g., `azd deploy frontend`).
    - This provisions defined resources in [infra/main.bicep](../infra/main.bicep) and deploys services defined in [azure.yaml](../azure.yaml#L6), generating a `.env` file for local development.

2. **Verify Deployment**
    - Run `azd show` to confirm resources and endpoints.

## Customizing or Configuring AZD Deployments

- **Workflow Definition**
  - [azure.yaml](./azure.yaml): Controls azd behavior, hooks, infrastructure definition, and app deployment.
- **Pre/Post Scripts**
  - [utils/azd/hooks](./utils/azd/hooks/): Holds scripts (e.g., `postprovision`) that update `.env`.
- **Infrastructure**
  - [infra/main.bicep](infra/main.bicep): Main entry point for infrastructure provisioning.
  - [infra/resources.bicep](infra/resources.bicep): Core deployment resources.
  - [infra/main.parameters.json](infra/main.parameters.json): Default deployment values, overrideable by ENV vars.
  - Use `azd provision` to only provision infrastructure.
- **Application Definitions**
  - Apps map to provisioned resources via tags, referencing service names in [azure.yaml](./azure.yaml).
  - For testing only the application layer, use `azd deploy <service>`.

### CI/CD with Azure Developer CLI (azd)

You can automate deployment with azd-generated pipelines.

1. **Create a Pipeline**
    - Run `azd pipeline config` to generate pipeline files for GitHub Actions.
2. **Use Existing Pipelines**
    - Reference [.github/workflows/azd_deploy.yml](../.github/workflows/azd_deploy.yml) for GitHub Actions.

### Required Secrets for Federated Workload Identities

Refer to [Azure GitHub OIDC docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/github/connect-from-azure-openid-connect) for creating these values.

Add these secrets and variables to your GitHub repository under "Secrets and variables" â†’ "Actions":

#### Secrets
- `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`: Client ID of your Service Principal/Managed Identity (e.g., `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`)
- `AZURE_TENANT_ID`: Your Azure Tenant ID (e.g., `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`)
- `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`: Your Azure Subscription ID (e.g., `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`)

#### Variables
- `AZURE_ENV_NAME`: Specifies the Azure Developer CLI environment name (e.g `dev`)
- `AZURE_LOCATION`: Specifies the Azure region to deploy to (e.g `eastus2`)

```yaml
name: Azure Developer CLI Deploy

on:
  push:
     branches:
        - main

jobs:
  build:
     runs-on: ubuntu-latest
     env:
        AZURE_CLIENT_ID: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CLIENT_ID }}
        AZURE_TENANT_ID: ${{ secrets.AZURE_TENANT_ID }}
        AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID: ${{ secrets.AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID }}
        AZURE_ENV_NAME: ${{ vars.AZURE_ENV_NAME }}
        AZURE_LOCATION: ${{ vars.AZURE_LOCATION }}
     steps:
        - name: Checkout
          uses: actions/checkout@v4
        - name: Install azd
          uses: Azure/setup-azd@v1.0.0
        - name: Log in with Azure (Federated Credentials)
          run: |
             azd auth login `
                --client-id "$Env:AZURE_CLIENT_ID" `
                --federated-credential-provider "github" `
                --tenant-id "$Env:AZURE_TENANT_ID"
          shell: pwsh
        - name: Provision Infrastructure
          id: provision
          run: azd up --no-prompt
          env:
             AZD_INITIAL_ENVIRONMENT_CONFIG: ${{ secrets.AZD_INITIAL_ENVIRONMENT_CONFIG }}
```

### Verify Deployment

After deployment, visit the service endpoints returned by `azd show`.

## Troubleshooting


1. **Authentication Errors**
    - Ensure that your Azure CLI is logged in with the correct account. (`az account show`)
    - Verify that the service principal or managed identity has the necessary permissions.

1. **Resource Provisioning Failures**
    - Check the Azure portal for any resource-specific error messages under the deployments tab.
    - Ensure that your subscription has sufficient quota and that the region supports the requested resources.

1. **Configuration Errors**
    1. **Check the AI Search Service**
        - Verify if the index has been properly created by checking the `Indexes`, `Indexer`, and `Data Source` tabs.
        - Ensure the managed identity used by the AI Search service has `Storage Blob Data Reader` or higher level of access to the storage account.
        - If no documents are populated, and there aren't any `Indexes`, `Indexers`, or `Data Sources` populated, then the `Container App Job` may have failed.
            - To retry or debug the `Container App Job`:
            ![Azure Portal Container App Job Retry](./images/azp_help_containerjoblogs_1.png)


1. **Pipeline Failures**
    - Check the pipeline logs for detailed error messages.
    - Ensure that all required secrets and variables are correctly configured in your GitHub repository.

1. **Application Errors**
    - View the detailed logs of the Container App:
        - First, navigate to either the `Logs` or `Log Stream`
            ![Azure Portal Container App Logs Navigation1](./images/azp_help_containerlogs_1.png)

            - `Log Stream` will stream the live data from your container, however when there are issues with the container itself, you may not be able to see the `console` log due to the container being in a failed state.

            - `Logs` will display all of your `system` and `console` logs, but there is a minor delay in the data.
